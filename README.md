# NeoVim configuration

This is my attempt to capture neovim configuration on its own without depending
on vim configuration.

I have started the config from the beggining as a learning oportunity instead
of just following the popular setups so it might very well have many issues

# Installation

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.config
git clone https://github.com/adorostkar/nvim.git .config/nvim
```
